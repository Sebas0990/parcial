<p>In the last 40 years video games have become one of the media made for entertainment more popular in the world, but despite this they do not have the prestige of movies, books or tv shows have, and I don’t think it’s fair, and that’s why I’m going to present to you why I think videogames are a form of art as respectable as any other media. </p>
<p>What is art? According to Cambridge Dictionary, art is “the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings” and I agree with that definition, I also think than there is so many levels of deepness that a work of art can have, and not every work had to be very complex in meaning and in the way than is made to be considered art, I also think than a piece of work that had a lot of effort behind it had to be consider art, because someone, or a group of people work very hard and in creative ways to make that project a reality. That being said, video games fit perfectly in those definitions of art. </p>
<p>Not only does it fit well in the definition, but it also had 2 very important things than deference it whit other forms of art, like a movie. One is the way they are made; the way programmers, visual artists and designers can create an adventure or a new world to explore, with a history waiting to be found by the player. What bring be to the second point, the relationship between the game and the player, it can generate some feeling than no movie or book can make, because you are the one living the adventure, the one making decisions, and that makes the experience feel personal. That’s why video games are a form of art, and a very special one. </p>
